# Setting up the server
Right now setting up and running the server is pretty simple!

### Requirements
```
```

A valid Maven (3.3.9 or higher recomended) is necessary: https://maven.apache.org/install.html

To use maven easily make sure that the mvn bin is in your terminal PATH.


### Running
From inside the LocMess-Server run in your terminal (verify there is a pom.xml file there):
```
mvn tomcat7:run
```
